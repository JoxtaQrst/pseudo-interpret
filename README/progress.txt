What we have so far:
    - read the input
    - functions!:
        * function which checks if the first chars in a line are whatever we want them to be
        * function which helps declare an integer in the struct and checks if the int is already declared
        * function to count lines
        * calculate math expressions (WIP)
            /\ to calculate the expression we must:
                1. extract the expression and put it in a char array
                2. find a way to use the variables and numbers
                3. take care of the signs
                4. take care of the parantheses
    - check if a line is code or comment and count them. (line number is used to print errors)
    - extract int variables and save them in a struct containing:
        * name
        * value
        * bool value which represents whether or not the position is used
