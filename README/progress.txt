What we have so far:
    - read the input
    - functions!:
        * function which checks if the first chars in a line are whatever we want them to be
        * function which helps declare an integer in the struct and checks if the int is already declared
        * function to count lines
        * function to check if is number
        * function to check if is variable
        * function to get value of var/number
        * function which calculates expressions
    - check if a line is code or comment and count them. (line number is used to print errors)
    - extract int variables and save them in a struct containing:
        * name
        * value
        * bool value which represents whether or not the position is used

TO - DO, for now:
    * interpret for
    * interpret while
    * interpret if
    * and take care of {}
    * delete useless comment lines that were once used as debug (my code is not clean and it looks bad)
