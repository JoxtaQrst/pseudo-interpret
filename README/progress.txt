What we have so far:
    - read the input
    - functions!:
        * function which checks if the first chars in a line are whatever we want them to be
        * function which helps declare an integer in the struct and checks if the int is already declared
        * function to count lines
    - check if a line is code or comment and count them. (line number is used to print errors)
    - extract int variables and save them in a struct containing:
        * name
        * value
        * bool value which represents whether or not the position is used

TO - DO, for now:
    * calculate math expressions (WIP)
        /\ to calculate the expression we must:
            1. extract the expression and put it in a char array - DONE
            2. check if the var is defined - DONE
            3. find a way to use the variables and numbers - mostly DONE
            4. take care of the signs - DONE
            5. take care of the parantheses - mostly DONE
                the equation calculator MOSTLY works for now. it was designed for two terms, 
            but works for more than two. var2 takes the rest of the equation and becomes a subeq.
    * delete useless comment lines that were once used as debug (my code is not clean and it looks bad)
